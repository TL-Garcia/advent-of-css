# Advent of CSS
----
These are my personal solutions for the challenges at [advent of css](https://store.selfteach.me/30f86466-aeb2-4b3c-b43d-5055f178493c). 
I've set myself the challenge of using different technologies from the ones 
that I use everyday, and also not looking at the solutions until I've finished
the whole bunch.

Therefore the code in this repo is not meant to be used in production, and is 
only uploaded for educational purposes.
